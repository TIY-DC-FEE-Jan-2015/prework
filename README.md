## Accounts

If you don't have them already, sign up for free accounts on the following services:

* [GitHub](http://github.com)
* [Twitter](http://twitter.com)
* [Medium](http://medium.com)
* [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com)

For GitHub at least, make sure to set your real name and add a picture of yourself. (I'm awful at remembering names and this will help.) E-mail your GitHub username to kyle.hill@theironyard.com so I can add you to the organization in advance of the class.

## Computer Setup

All students need to be using a MacBook with OSX Yosemite. (To check the version, click on the Apple icon on the task bar, then "About This Mac.")

If you're on an older version of OSX, you can upgrade for free through the App Store. The upgrade takes a while to download, and then install, and requires a restart, so you might want to do it over lunch or an evening.

## HTML and CSS

HTML and CSS are the foundation of content on any webpage or web app. We're only going be spending about a week on them, so you should have a basic foundation before the class starts.

Work on the [HTML and CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web) Codecademy course. Completing it should take you around 6-8 hours, depending on your prior experience.

## Command Line

The command line (or "terminal") is the gateway to your computer's internals. It's a more direct and customizable way to do things that you'd usually do through a graphical user interface.

The command line can seem imposing and scary the first few times you're interacting with it. But: the two tools we're going to use the most as front end developers are the command line and a simple text editor, so we need to get comfortable with it.

Go through the first section of Treehouse's [Console Foundations course](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#getting-started-with-the-console). Treehouse costs money, but if you create an account it's free for the first 14 days.

If you don't want to sign up for Treehouse, this [Lifehacker post](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything) does an alright decent job of demystifying the process of traversing around your computer's folder and file structure, much like you would in Finder.

Hard mode: Go through the "Users and Permissions" and "Processes" sections on the Treehouse course as well.

## Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

It is a command line tool that we will be using for every project we do in class. You don't need to become an expert before the class, but try to start getting comfortable.

Make sure you go through the [git tutorial](https://try.github.io) on GitHub.

Hard mode: If you're comfortable with git already and itching for more, the [git immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) course is great.


## Typing

One of the main skills you'll develop as a programmer is hunting down bugs in your code - "I expected X to happen, but it didn't, and this line of code is where things start to go wrong." An embarrassing amount of these bugs -- for every programmer in the world, ever -- are simple typing and spelling errors.

If you don't know how to touch type (i.e. type without looking at the keyboard), try to spend some time each day working on touch typing (you can try [keybr.com](http://keybr.com)). If you already know how to touch type, I would highly recommend working through the JavaScript lessons on [typing.io](http://typing.io). Don't worry about what the code's actually doing. Just try and get comfortable with stroking special characters as often as you stroke letters.
