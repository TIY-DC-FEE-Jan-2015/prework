## Computer Setup

All students need to be using a MacBook with OSX Yosemite. (To check the version, click on the Apple icon on the task bar, then "About This Mac.")

If you're on an older vgrsion of OSX, you can upgrade for free through the App Store. The upgrade takes a while to download, and then install, and requires a restart, so you might want to do it over lunch or an evening.

## HTML and CSS

## Command Line

## Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

It is a command line tool that we will be using for every project we do in class. You don't need to become an expert before the class, but try to start getting comfortable.

Make sure you go through the [git tutorial](https://try.github.io) on GitHub.

Hard mode: If you're comfortable with git already and itching for more, the [git immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) course is great.


## Typing

One of the main skills you'll develop as a programmer is hunting down bugs in your code - "I expected X to happen, but it didn't, and this line of code is where things start to go wrong." An embarrassing amount of these bugs -- for every programmer in the world, ever -- are simple typing and spelling errors.

If you don't know how to touch type (i.e. type without looking at the keyboard), try to spend some time each day working on touch typing (you can try [keybr.com](http://keybr.com)). If you already know how to touch type, I would highly recommend working through the JavaScript lessons on [typing.io](http://typing.io). Don't worry about what the code's actually doing (it's actually really ugly), just try and get comfortable with stroking special characters as often as you stroke letters.
